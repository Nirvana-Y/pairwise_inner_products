# pairwise_inner_products
Pairwise Inner Products of Row Vectors:  Consider a matrix of size N by M, and each row in the matrix is considered as a vector of length M. Pairwise inner products of row vectors are to calculate inner products of all possible pairs of different rows in the matrix. For N rows there are N*(N-1)/2 such pairs. Assume N is equal to 6, for example, we have the following 15 row pairs:
(0, 1)(0, 2)(0, 3)(0, 4)(0, 5)
(1, 2)(1, 3)(1, 4)(1, 5)
(2, 3)(2, 4)(2, 5)
(3, 4)(3, 5)
(4, 5)
You are asked to design a parallel algorithm and implement it using MPI non-blocking send/recv communication functions.
 
In the parallel algorithm design you must consider efficiency issues, that is, try to
* minimize communication costs and
* balance the workloads among all processes.
 
In the implementation
* You must use MPI non-blocking send/recv.
* The processes are organized as a one-dimensional linear array.
* For simplicity assume N  , is divisible by p for p being the number of processes.
* Again for simplicity you may restrict p to be either an odd, or even number to achieve the best possible load balancing.
* Your program must produce correct results for p being greater than or equal to one.
* Your program needs to ask for the matrix sizes N and M as user defined parameters, and must print out the results in the same (row-wise) order as shown in the above example.
* After the parallel computation, you main program must conduct a self-checking, i.e., first perform a sequential computation using the same data set and then compare the two results.
